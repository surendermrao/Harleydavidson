Q: List the components required to build Amazon VPC?

Ans: Subnet, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, HW VPN Connection, Virtual Private Gateway, Customer Gateway, Router, Peering Connection, VPC Endpoint for S3, Egress-only Internet Gateway.
Q: How do you safeguard your EC2 instances running in a VPC?

Ans: Security Groups can be used to protect your EC2 instances in a VPC. We can configure both INBOUND and OUTBOUND traffic in a Security Group which enables secured access to your EC2 instances. Security Group automatically denies any unauthorized access to your EC2 instances.
Q: In a VPC how many EC2 instances can you use?

Ans: Initially you are limited to launch 20 EC2 Instances at one time. Maximum VPC  size is 65,536 instances.
Q: Can you establish a peering connection to a VPC in a different REGION?

Ans: Not possible. Peering Connection are available only between VPC in the same region.
Q: Can you connect your VPC with a VPC owned by another AWS account?

Ans: Yes, Possible. Provided the owner of other VPCs accepts your connection.
Q: What are all the different connectivity options available for your VPC?

Ans: Internet Gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, NAT, EndPoints, Peering Connections.
Q: Can a EC2 instance inside your VPC connect with the EC2 instance belonging to other VPCs?

Ans: Yes, Possible. Provided an Internet Gateway is configured in such a way that traffic bounded for EC2 instances running in other VPCs.
Q: How can you monitor network traffic in your VPC?

Ans: It is possible using Amazon VPC Flow-Logs feature.
Q: Difference between Security Groups and ACLs in a VPC?

Ans: A Security Group defines which traffic is allowed TO or FROM  EC2 instance. Whereas ACL, controls at the SUBNET level, scrutinize the traffic TO or FROM a Subnet.

Ans: When a DB instance is deleted, RDS retains the user-created DB snapshot along with all other manually created DB snapshots. Also automated backups are deleted and only manually created DB Snapshots are retained.
Q: What is the significance of an Elastic IP?

Ans: The Public IP is associated with the instance until it is stopped or terminated Only. A Public IP is not static. Every time your instance is stopped or terminated the associated Public IP gets vanished and a new Public IP gets assigned with that instance. To over come this issue a public IP can be replaced by an Elastic IP address, which stays with the instance as long as the user doesn’t manually detach it. Similarly when if you are hosting multiple websites on your EC2 server, in that case you may require more than one Elastic IP address.
Q: How will you use S3 with your EC2 instances?

Ans: Websites hosted on your EC2 instances can load their static contents directly from S3. It provides highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure.
Q: Is this possible to connect your company datacenter to Amazon Cloud?

Ans: Yes, you can very well do this  by establishing a VPN connection between your company’s network and Amazon VPC.
Q: Can you change the Private IP of an EC2 instance while it is running or stopped?

Ans: A Private IP is STATIC. And it is attached with an instance throughout is lifetime and cannot be changed.
Q: What is the use of Subnets?

Ans: When a network has more number of HOSTS, managing these hosts can be tedious under a single large network. Therefore we divide this large network into easily manageable sub-networks (subnets) so that managing hosts under each subnet becomes easier.
Q: What is the use of Route Table?

Ans: Route Table is used to route the network pockets. Generally one route table would be available in each subnet. Route table can have any no. of records or information, hence attaching multiple subnets to a route table is also possible.
Q: Can you use the Standby DB instance for read and write along with your Primary DB instance?

Ans: Standby server cannot be used in parallel with primary server unless your Primary instance goes down.
Q: What is the use of Connection Draining?

Ans: Connection Draining is a service under Elastic Load Balancing. It keeps monitoring the healthiness of the instances. If any instance fails Connection Draining pulls all the traffic from that particular failed instance and re-route the traffic to other healthy instances.

Q: What’s the difference between instance store and EBS?

Issue

I’m not sure whether to store the data associated with my Amazon EC2 instance in instance store or  in an attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Which option is best for me?

Ans: Resolution
Some Amazon EC2 instance types come with a form of directly attached, block-device storage known as the instance store. The instance store is ideal for temporary storage, because the data stored in instance store volumes is not persistent through instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures. You can find more detailed information about the instance store at Amazon EC2 Instance Store.

For data you want to retain longer-term, or if you need to encrypt the data, we recommend using EBS volumes instead. EBS volumes preserve their data through instance stops and terminations, can be easily backed up with EBS snapshots, can be removed from instances and reattached to another, and support full-volume encryption. For more detailed information about EBS volumes, see Features of Amazon EBS.
